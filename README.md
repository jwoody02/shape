supreme iOS bot made in swift. made back in 2018 so backend is most likely partially out of date right now (need to add more anti bot fixes)
In total about ~20k lines of code by me and this was the first real app I mdae with swift so there may be some bugs or ui issues.

may look into updating to swift 5 and fixing alot of ui bugs. It'll probably only work on 6.1 in. iPhones and will not properly render on any other phone lol -- keep in mind this was my very first legit app in swift so it's not perfect by any means.
